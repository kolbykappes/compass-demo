      {
        "objection": "AI can't handle our complex and specialized documentation requirements.",
        "response": "That's a very common concern. Our approach isn't off-the-shelf; we fine-tune the AI on your specific content. For our client, we built custom components to handle their unique technical and regulatory needs, which was key to the project's success."

      {
        "objection": "We're worried about the quality and accuracy of AI-generated content.",
        "response": "A valid point. We built a 'human-in-the-loop' quality control workflow directly into the solution. This combination of AI generation and expert review actually improved their content consistency and reduced quality control effort by 80%."

      {
        "objection": "A project like this sounds too expensive and difficult to implement.",
        "response": "We understand that perception. However, this client achieved a full return on their investment in under 12 months, driven by the $1.2M in annual savings. We focus on a phased approach that delivers value quickly."

      {
        "objection": "Our current technical writers are skeptical of AI taking their jobs.",
        "response": "We see AI as a tool to augment, not replace, experts. Our solution freed up their writers from tedious information gathering, allowing them to focus on higher-value work like content strategy and editing. Their job satisfaction actually increased."
