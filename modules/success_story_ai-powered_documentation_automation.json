      "body": "Dear [Prospect Name],\n\nTechnical documentation processes often consume excessive time and resources, with technical writers spending up to 70% of their time manually gathering information while quality remains inconsistent.\n\nEliassen Group's AI & Data practice recently partnered with a leading financial institution to transform their approach to technical documentation through:\n\n• AI agent framework with specialized components for quality control\n• Custom Microsoft Copilot implementation with specialized prompts\n• Intelligent content extraction from code repositories\n• AI-assisted content generation tailored to different audience personas\n\nUnlike generic automation approaches, our solution delivered targeted improvements specific to documentation workflows. The results were compelling: 65% reduction in documentation creation time, 80% decrease in quality control effort, and annual cost savings exceeding $1.2M.\n\nI'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how similar approaches might benefit [Company Name]'s documentation processes. Would you be available for a brief 20-minute conversation next week to explore this further?\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title]\nEliassen Group",
