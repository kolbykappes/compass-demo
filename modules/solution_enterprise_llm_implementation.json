We'd welcome a brief conversation about moving from experimentation to production value.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title]\nEliassen Group\n\nP.S. Our LLM Readiness Assessment typically identifies 2-3 high-impact use cases in the first conversation."

            "key_message": "The reason I'm asking is we keep running into companies that have done some AI pilots but can't seem to get anything into production. We've actually cracked that code and helped 30+ organizations move from experimentation to real business value.",
            "evidence_point": "Just last month, we took a financial services company from a basic ChatGPT pilot to a full production system that's saving them over a million dollars a year. The key was connecting the AI to their actual business data - not just using it in isolation.",
            "engagement_question": "So at Regional Bank Corp, are you finding yourself in that same spot - where AI seems promising but you're not sure how to make it actually work for your business?",
            "voicemail": "Hi [Prospect Name], [Your Name] from Eliassen Group. We help companies move AI projects from pilot purgatory to production value. Just helped a financial firm go from basic AI experiments to $1M+ annual savings. Figured you might be wrestling with the same challenge. Call me back at [phone number]. Thanks!"
