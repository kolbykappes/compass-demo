Our Delivery Assessment typically identifies 2-3 constraints that, once addressed, accelerate deployment by 50%+.",

                "response": "That's excellent foundation. The opportunity is looking at the entire flow from idea to production. Individual teams might be agile, but if they're not coordinating on the end-to-end flow, you still get delays. Eliassen helps optimize the whole system, not just parts."

                "objection": "Our problem is technical debt, not process.",
                "response": "Technical debt is real and impacts delivery. The question is whether it's the primary constraint. Eliassen helps identify if technical debt is truly limiting deployment or if there are other bottlenecks to address first. Sometimes fixing a process constraint gives you breathing room to address technical debt."

                "objection": "We've tried improvement initiatives before and they didn't stick.",

                "response": "Fast deployment enables innovation. When you can get to production quickly, you can test more ideas and pivot based on real feedback. Slow deployment kills innovation because you're investing heavily before knowing if ideas work."
