      {
        "objection": "We prefer to maintain control over our projects and don't want to outsource ownership.",
        "response": "That's exactly why we offer talent services and managed team models. You maintain full control and decision-making authority while gaining access to specialized expertise. Many clients start there and evolve to other models as trust builds."

      {
        "objection": "We've had bad experiences with consulting firms over-promising and under-delivering.",
        "response": "That's unfortunately common with firms that use a one-size-fits-all approach. Our strength is honestly assessing your situation and recommending the engagement model that matches your capacity and constraints. We'd rather recommend a smaller, successful engagement than over-promise."

      {
        "objection": "We're not sure we have the budget for comprehensive professional services.",
        "response": "Our engagement models are designed to be cost-effective at different budget levels. Talent services can be very economical for specific expertise gaps, while managed projects often deliver better ROI than traditional approaches. We can discuss options that fit your budget constraints."

      {
        "objection": "We need services that can scale up and down based on project phases.",
        "response": "That's precisely why we offer multiple engagement models that can transition based on your needs. Many clients start with managed projects for rapid delivery, then shift to talent services for ongoing support. This flexibility is a core part of our approach."
      },
      {
        "objection": "We're concerned about knowledge transfer and avoiding vendor lock-in.",
        "response": "Knowledge transfer is built into every engagement model we offer. Our goal is always to build your internal capabilities, not create dependency. We measure success partly by how well your team can sustain the solution after our engagement ends."
