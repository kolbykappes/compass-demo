      "body": "Hi [Prospect Name],\n\nMany technology projects fail not because of technical challenges, but because the engagement model doesn't match the organization's needs, constraints, and internal capabilities.\n\nEliassen Group offers four proven engagement models that we tailor to your specific situation:\n\n• **Talent Services** - Skilled consultants you manage directly for immediate capacity\n• **Managed Teams/PODs** - Cross-functional teams we build and oversee for specific initiatives  \n• **Managed Projects** - Complete project ownership with defined deliverables and timelines\n• **Managed Services** - Long-term operational responsibility for critical functions\n\nThis flexibility is why we maintain 400+ active client relationships with industry-leading satisfaction scores.\n\nRecent example: A healthcare organization needed rapid AI implementation but lacked internal expertise. We started with a managed project approach, delivered a working AI platform in 16 weeks, then transitioned to talent services to build their internal team capabilities.\n\nThe key is matching the engagement model to your specific goals, timeline, and internal capacity.\n\nWould you be open to a 15-minute call to discuss which approach might work best for your current technology priorities?\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

      "inmessage_body": "Hi [Prospect Name],\n\nI've been following [Company]'s technology initiatives and wanted to share some insights about engagement models that drive successful outcomes.\n\nAt Eliassen Group, we've learned that project success often depends more on the engagement approach than the technology itself. We offer four distinct models:\n\n• Talent Services for immediate capacity\n• Managed Teams for complex initiatives requiring coordination\n• Managed Projects for complete delivery ownership\n• Managed Services for ongoing operational responsibility\n\nWe recently helped a financial services company reduce project delivery time by 60% simply by switching from a traditional staff augmentation model to our managed team approach.\n\nWould you be interested in a 20-minute conversation about how the right engagement model could accelerate your current technology initiatives?\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

      {
        "objection": "We prefer to maintain control over our projects and don't want to outsource ownership.",
        "response": "That's exactly why we offer talent services and managed team models. You maintain full control and decision-making authority while gaining access to specialized expertise. Many clients start there and evolve to other models as trust builds."
      },
      {
        "objection": "We've had bad experiences with consulting firms over-promising and under-delivering.",
        "response": "That's unfortunately common with firms that use a one-size-fits-all approach. Our strength is honestly assessing your situation and recommending the engagement model that matches your capacity and constraints. We'd rather recommend a smaller, successful engagement than over-promise."
      },
      {
        "objection": "We're not sure we have the budget for comprehensive professional services.",
        "response": "Our engagement models are designed to be cost-effective at different budget levels. Talent services can be very economical for specific expertise gaps, while managed projects often deliver better ROI than traditional approaches. We can discuss options that fit your budget constraints."
      },
      {
        "objection": "We need services that can scale up and down based on project phases.",
        "response": "That's precisely why we offer multiple engagement models that can transition based on your needs. Many clients start with managed projects for rapid delivery, then shift to talent services for ongoing support. This flexibility is a core part of our approach."
      },
      {
        "objection": "We're concerned about knowledge transfer and avoiding vendor lock-in.",
        "response": "Knowledge transfer is built into every engagement model we offer. Our goal is always to build your internal capabilities, not create dependency. We measure success partly by how well your team can sustain the solution after our engagement ends."
