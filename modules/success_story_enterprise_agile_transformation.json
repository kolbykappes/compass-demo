      "body": "When a Fortune 100 corporation acquired a digitally-advanced company, they faced a critical decision: force the acquisition to adopt their slower traditional processes, or learn from their agility and transform their entire enterprise.\n\nThey chose transformation. Our Enterprise Agility team worked with them to scale modern development practices across 45,000+ employees in 6 global locations, deploying 25 agile coaches in the first six months.\n\nThe business transformation results were remarkable:\n• 200% average improvement in team speed, productivity, and quality\n• Delivery cycle time reduced from 18 months to 6 weeks\n• Complete organizational transformation from traditional service company to technology-first operation\n• Successful scaling across multiple lines of business and international locations\n\nThis wasn't just process change - it was fundamental business model transformation that repositioned them as a technology company offering services, rather than a traditional service company using technology.\n\nThe key was establishing a guiding coalition across functions and leveraging training and coaching as core transformation elements, rather than relying solely on process changes.\n\nWould you be interested in a 20-minute discussion about how enterprise agility transformation could accelerate your organization's digital evolution?"
