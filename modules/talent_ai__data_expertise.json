It's a common and costly problem.\\n\\nOur Data & AI practice is built to solve this. We provide consultants who combine deep technical skill with proven financial services experience. They understand your world, from regulatory pressures to specific data security needs.\\n\\nWe recently placed a data architect with a wealth management firm who was contributing to high-level design decisions in her second week. Her domain knowledge allowed her to bypass the typical six-month learning curve.\\n\\nCould your most critical projects benefit from that kind of immediate impact? If so, I'd welcome a brief 15-minute call to discuss your talent needs.\\n\\nBest,\\n[Your Name]"
