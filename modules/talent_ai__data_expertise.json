        "key_message": "I'm calling because we keep hearing from bank CTOs that finding data and AI talent who actually understand financial services is nearly impossible. Everyone knows the tech, but they don't get the business. We've built a practice specifically around solving that problem.",
        "evidence_point": "Just placed a data architect who started making an impact from day one because she understood both the technical requirements and why banks need certain compliance controls. No six-month learning curve - she was contributing to architectural decisions in week two.",
